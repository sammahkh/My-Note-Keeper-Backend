# My Note Keeper (Backend)

This is the **backend API** for the My Note Keeper app â€” a simple RESTful API built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB** to manage notes (create, read, update, delete, search).

The frontend is hosted separately in a different repository: [my-note-keeper](https://github.com/sammahkh/My-Note-Keeper-Frontend)

The backend is **deployed on Render**
